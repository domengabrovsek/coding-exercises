## description
Some of my friends wanted to learn coding and I've decided to help them by creating this repository.

## get started
```js

// checkout the code
git clone https://github.com/domengabrovsek/coding-exercises.git

// make sure you have nodejs installed
node --version
npm --version

// install dependencies
npm install

// run all tests
npm run test

// run tests for specific exercises
npm run test:1
npm run test:2
npm run test:3

// implement functions in index.js files and make all tests pass
```
