Exercises for practicing basic coding skills.

## get started
```js

// make sure you have nodejs installed
node --version
npm --version

// if npm version is lower than 8.0.0 then upgrade it
npm install -g npm

// install dependencies
npm install

// run tests
npm run test

// create your own branch - DO NOT COMMIT AND PUSH CHANGES TO MASTER

// implement functions in index.js files and make all tests pass
```
