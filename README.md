Simple exercises for practicing basic coding skills.

## description
Some of my friends wanted to learn coding and I've decided to help them by creating this repository.

## get started
```js

// checkout the code
git clone https://github.com/domengabrovsek/coding-exercises.git

// make sure you have nodejs installed
node --version
npm --version

// if npm version is lower than 8.0.0 then upgrade it
npm install -g npm

// install dependencies
npm install

// run tests
npm run test

// implement functions in index.js files and make all tests pass
```
